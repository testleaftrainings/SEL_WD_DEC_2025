Abstraction:
Abstraction is a process of hiding the implementation details and showing only functionality to the user. 
It lets you focus on what the object does instead of how it does it.
In Java, abstraction is achieved using abstract classes and interfaces.

abstract class Animal {
    abstract void sound();
    void eat() {
        System.out.println("This animal eats food.");
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    void sound() {
        System.out.println("Dog barks");
    }
}

class Cat extends Animal {
    void sound() {
        System.out.println("Cat meows");
    }
}




Polymorphism in Java is a concept by which we can perform a single action in different ways.
It is derived from two Greek words: "poly" and "morphs". "Poly" means many and "morphs" means forms.

Types - compile-time polymorphism - runtime polymorphism. 

Compile-time polymorphism is achieved by method overloading, 
while runtime polymorphism is achieved by method overriding. 
- It allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common super class for seamless interaction, typically through the use of method overriding within an inheritance hierarchy. - This enables Java programs to be written more abstractly, promoting scalability and maintainability.

//static ,compile- time,early, method overloading

Overloading: - It refers to the ability to create multiple methods of the same name 
with different implementations or arguments pass.
-Calls to an overloaded method will run a specific implementation of that method appropriate 
to the context, based on the number and type of arguments passed.


public void browser(String name){

}


public void browser(int version,String name){

}

public void browser(int data,String Value,double x){

}

public void browser(String name,int version){

}



framework:

pubic void startApp(String url){
default browser - chrome

}


public void startApp(String browser, String url){

}
